# Lab 02: Debugging

## Lab Goals

 - To learn how to debug Rust programs with GDB

## Differences from the Java version

 - The Java version of this lab uses Intellij's debugger rather than GDB.
 - Due to Linked Lists being challenging in Rust, and GDB being challenging to use, this is easily the hardest lab in the Rust version of the course. In the future, the `IntList` portion may be cut out to focus on debugging.
