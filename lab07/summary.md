## Assignment Overview


You will be creating a `BSTMap<K, V>` type, which should go in a file named `bstmap.rs`.

## Running the Program


To test the required methods, run `cargo test map`. To test the optional methods as well, run `cargo test`.

Once you have a working implementation of `BSTMap`, run the benchmarks with `cargo run --release`.

## Submitting Your Code

Before submitting your code, make sure to:
 - Run `cargo clippy` and fix any warnings that appear.
 - Run `cargo fmt` to format your code according to the Rust style guidelines.
 - Commit and push your code to your repository.

Then, submit your code to the [Gradescope assignment](https://cheese.com/).
