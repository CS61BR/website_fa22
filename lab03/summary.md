## Assignment Overview

For the benchmarking part of the lab, you will be writing `benchmark` in `benchmarks.rs`. You will then fix the resize strategy in `alist.rs`.

For the testing part of the lab, you will be writing tests in `randomized_test/mod.rs`. You will then fix a bug in `buggyalist.rs`.

## Running the Programs

To run the benchmarks, run `cargo run --release Vec AList SLList`. To run the tests, run `cargo test`.

## Submitting Your Code

Before submitting your code, make sure to:
 - Run `cargo clippy` and fix any warnings that appear.
 - Run `cargo fmt` to format your code according to the Rust style guidelines.
 - Commit and push your code to your repository.

Then, submit your code to the [Gradescope assignment](https://cheese.com/).
